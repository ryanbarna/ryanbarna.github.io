I graduated Montana State University in 2021 after completing my double major in chemical and biological engineering and my minor in mathematics. Currently, I work as a flight software engineer at the Space Science and Engineering Lab at Montana State University. My experience is primarily with software, but I have worked hard to develop experience in all aspects of engineering. I have spent time troubleshooting embedded electrical systems, fabricating mechanical components, rebuilding and maintaining engines, and running chemistry experiments.
